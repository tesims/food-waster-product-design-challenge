# The Slap: Reducing Food Waste Product Design Challenge

The slap is an innovative solution designed to help reduce consumer food waste by providing a simple and intuitive way to track the freshness of food stored in containers. This product was developed as part of a four-month-long product design challenge aimed at reducing consumer waste.

## Features

- Easy to Use: The Slap is a small, adhesive light strip that easily attaches to any food container, making it simple to track the freshness of your stored food.
- Visual Freshness Indicator: Each day, a new light on the strip illuminates, providing a clear visual indication of how many days the food has been stored in the fridge.
- Expiration Alert: After 7 days, the light strip begins blinking red, alerting you that the food may no longer be safe to consume, helping to prevent food waste and potential health risks.
- Versatile: FreshStrip can be used on a wide variety of food containers, from plastic storage containers to glass jars, making it a versatile solution for any kitchen.
- Battery-Powered: The light strip is powered by a small, replaceable battery, ensuring long-lasting performance without the need for constant recharging.

## Prototype
The current prototype has been developed to demonstrate the core functionality and design of the product. It features a compact, adhesive light strip with 7 individual LED lights, each representing a day of the week. The prototype is powered by a small, rechargable lipo battery and includes a simple microcontroller to manage the light sequence and expiration alert.
